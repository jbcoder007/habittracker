This app will help you track habits, whether you are looking to build a new habit or break an old one. 
It will help you keep track of your progress and help you stay motivated.

You can create as many habits as you want. For each habit, you will be prompted to assign a name, description,
periodicity (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) as well as the minimum and maximum amount of times you want a  habit to occur within a period.

For each habit you create, you can edit any of its attributes using the 'Edit habit' Functionality or delete them compeletly
